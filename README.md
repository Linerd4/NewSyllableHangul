# Hangul Syllable Generator

This is a really simple Bash script that generates Hangul syllables. Unfortunately, there's no TTS for korean available on Linux (at least, from my researches), that could have been useful to check if the user spelled the syllable correctly or not.

I spent a bunch of evenings researching how to correctly render hangul characters, and it has been quite interesting. If I ever find the source material for this script, I'll put the links here.

## Dependencies
Bash is more than enough. Just be sure to have enabled Korean in the `locale.conf` file and then generated it with `locale-gen` (at least on Arch Linux, no idea on Debian-based distros and others).
